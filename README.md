# ThesisProject
Data analysis of my Thesis research with Python.

I graduated from City College with an M.S. in Chemistry and I performed independent research to compose my own thesis paper. I used Excel to analyze
the data, but here I'm applying my new programming skills to analyze the same data with Python.
